**Figure 1: KryptoBot System Architecture**

The diagram above illustrates the modular architecture of the KryptoBot Trading System. The Trading Bot core serves as the central component, coordinating interactions between various modules. Market data flows from the Market Data Service to the Trading Bot, which processes this information using Trading Strategies and ML Enhancer to generate trading signals. These signals are then executed through the Broker Integration module. The Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and control capabilities, while the Performance Analysis module evaluates trading outcomes. The Parameter Tuner and Portfolio Optimizer continuously refine the system's operation based on performance metrics. The Sleep Manager controls the bot's activity cycles based on market hours.

- **Advanced Trading Strategies**: Implements breakout, trend-following, mean reversion, and momentum strategies
- **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Uses ML models to improve trading signals and predict market movements
- **Risk Management**: Implements position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, and maximum drawdown protection
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Provides comprehensive monitoring of trading activities and performance metrics
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimizes asset allocation based on risk/reward profiles
- **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Adjusts strategy parameters based on market conditions

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following settings:

```
# Broker API Configuration
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

# MetaTrader Configuration
MT_SERVER=your_server
MT_PORT=your_port
MT_USERNAME=your_username
MT_PASSWORD=your_password

# Email Notifications
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Trading Parameters
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.02
STOP_LOSS_PCT=0.02
TAKE_PROFIT_PCT=0.04
MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT=0.05

# SSL Configuration
SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cacert.pem
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/cacert.pem
```

### Strategy Parameters (`config.py`)

The `config.py` file contains parameters for different trading strategies:

```python
# Breakout strategy parameters
BREAKOUT_PARAMS = {
    'lookback_period': 20,
    'consolidation_threshold': 0.01,
    'volume_threshold': 2.0,
    'price_threshold': 0.02
}

# Trend following strategy parameters
TREND_PARAMS = {
    'short_ma': 10,
    'medium_ma': 20,
    'long_ma': 50,
    'rsi_period': 14,
    'rsi_overbought': 70,
    'rsi_oversold': 30
}
```

### Watchlists

Configure the assets to trade in `config.py`:

```python
# Stocks watchlist
WATCHLIST = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']

# Forex watchlist
FOREX_WATCHLIST = ['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', 'AUDUSD']
```

## Security & Compliance

### Credential Management

The system implements several layers of protection for sensitive credentials:

- **Environment Variables**: All API keys, passwords, and sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables, not in the code.
- **Encryption**: Credentials stored in configuration files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
- **Key Rotation**: The system supports automatic key rotation for API credentials.
- **Secure Storage**: For production deployments, credentials can be stored in a secure vault like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

```python
# Example of secure credential loading
def load_credentials():
    """Load credentials from environment or secure storage"""
    # Try environment variables first
    api_key = os.environ.get('ALPACA_API_KEY')
    secret_key = os.environ.get('ALPACA_SECRET_KEY')
    
    # Fall back to secure storage if not in environment
    if not api_key or not secret_key:
        from utils.secure_storage import SecureStorage
        storage = SecureStorage()
        api_key = storage.get('ALPACA_API_KEY')
        secret_key = storage.get('ALPACA_SECRET_KEY')
    
    return api_key, secret_key
```

### Secure Deployment

The system includes several security measures for deployment:

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All web interfaces (dashboard) enforce HTTPS connections.
- **IP Restrictions**: Access to the dashboard and API endpoints can be restricted to specific IP addresses.
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Firewall Rules**: Recommended firewall configurations are provided for production deployments.

```bash
# Example of setting up IP restrictions in nginx
location /api/ {
    # Allow only specific IPs
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;  # Internal network
    allow 203.0.113.42;    # Office IP
    deny all;              # Deny all other IPs
    
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5001;
}
```

### Logging & Monitoring for Security

The system implements comprehensive security logging:

- **Access Logs**: All access to the dashboard and API endpoints is logged.
- **Authentication Logs**: Failed authentication attempts are logged and can trigger alerts.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual trading patterns or access patterns are flagged for review.
- **Audit Trail**: All system changes and trading actions are recorded in an immutable audit trail.

```python
# Example of security logging
def log_security_event(event_type, details, severity="INFO"):
    """Log security-related events"""
    logger = logging.getLogger('security')
    log_entry = {
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'event_type': event_type,
        'details': details,
        'severity': severity,
        'source_ip': request.remote_addr if 'request' in globals() else 'internal'
    }
    logger.log(getattr(logging, severity), json.dumps(log_entry))
    
    # Alert on high-severity events
    if severity in ["WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"]:
        send_security_alert(log_entry)
```

### Compliance Standards

The system is designed to adhere to relevant financial and security standards:

- **OWASP Security Guidelines**: Follows the OWASP Top 10 security recommendations.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implements data protection measures in accordance with GDPR.
- **Financial Regulations**: Designed to support compliance with relevant trading regulations.
- **Data Retention**: Implements configurable data retention policies.

### Security Audit Recommendations

Regular security audits are recommended:

1. **Quarterly Dependency Audits**: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
2. **Annual Penetration Testing**: Conduct penetration testing of the dashboard and API.
3. **Bi-annual Code Review**: Perform security-focused code reviews.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous security monitoring.
