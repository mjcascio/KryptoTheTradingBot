# Machine Learning Integration for KryptoBot

This document describes the machine learning components integrated into the KryptoBot trading system.

## Overview

KryptoBot now includes several machine learning components:

1. **ML Signal Enhancer**: A RandomForest classifier that enhances trading signals by predicting the probability of successful trades.
2. **Anomaly Detector**: An LSTM autoencoder neural network that identifies unusual market patterns that may indicate trading opportunities or risks.
3. **Ensemble Learning**: A voting ensemble of multiple ML models that provides more robust trading signals.
4. **Time Series Forecasting**: LSTM/GRU neural networks that predict future price movements to enhance trading decisions.

## Components

### ML Signal Enhancer

The ML Signal Enhancer uses a RandomForest classifier to enhance trading signals generated by traditional technical analysis strategies. It:

- Extracts features from market data (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Predicts the probability of a successful trade
- Adjusts position sizes based on confidence
- Filters out low-confidence signals

#### Features Used

- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- MACD Signal Line
- Bollinger Bands (upper and lower)
- Volume Ratio
- Price Change
- ATR (Average True Range)
- Trend Strength

### Anomaly Detector

The Anomaly Detector uses an LSTM autoencoder neural network to identify unusual market patterns. It:

- Learns the normal patterns in market data
- Identifies deviations from these patterns
- Flags potential trading opportunities or risks
- Provides visualization of anomalies

#### Architecture

- LSTM Autoencoder with 64 units
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Time-distributed dense output layer
- Trained to reconstruct sequences of market data

### Ensemble Learning

The Ensemble Learning module combines predictions from multiple ML models to provide more robust trading signals. It:

- Integrates multiple model types (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost)
- Uses voting to combine model predictions
- Provides more reliable probability estimates
- Adjusts position sizes based on ensemble confidence

#### Models Used

- RandomForest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier

### Time Series Forecasting

The Time Series Forecasting module uses LSTM and GRU neural networks to predict future price movements. It:

- Predicts price movements for a configurable forecast horizon
- Combines predictions from multiple models for more robust forecasts
- Generates trading signals based on predicted trends
- Adjusts position sizes based on forecast confidence
- Provides visualization of forecasts

#### Architecture

- LSTM and GRU neural networks
- Sequence-to-sequence prediction
- Dropout and BatchNormalization for regularization
- Support for both univariate and multivariate forecasting

### Feature Selection

KryptoBot now includes a feature selection module that identifies the most predictive features for the ML model. This helps improve model performance by focusing on the most important features.

#### Run Feature Selection

```bash
./run_feature_selection.sh
```

This will:
- Analyze feature importance from the trained model
- Try different feature selection methods:
  - Importance threshold (features with importance >= 0.05)
  - Top N features (top 5 most important features)
  - Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)
- Compare performance of models with different feature sets
- Select the best feature set based on F1 score improvement
- Update the ML model with the selected features

#### Feature Selection Results

The feature selection process generates several visualizations and metrics:
- `results/feature_selection/feature_importance.png`: Bar chart of feature importance
- `results/feature_selection/rfecv_scores.png`: Cross-validation scores for different numbers of features
