# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the KryptoBot Trading System.

## Sensitive Data Protection

### Secure Configuration
- All sensitive data (API keys, credentials) is encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Master password required for accessing encrypted configuration
- Configuration stored in user's home directory with restricted permissions
- Salt-based key derivation using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 480,000 iterations

### File Security
- Configuration directory: `~/.kryptobot/`
- Permissions set to 700 (only owner can read/write)
- Encryption key file: `.key` (600 permissions)
- Encrypted config file: `config.encrypted` (600 permissions)

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Authentication
- Secure storage of API credentials
- Per-source authentication implementation
- Signature-based authentication for supported platforms
- Automatic credential verification before operations

### Exchange-Specific Security
1. **Alpaca**
   - API key/secret authentication
   - Secure WebSocket connection with authentication headers

2. **Binance**
   - HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication
   - Timestamp-based request signing
   - WebSocket authentication before subscription

3. **Coinbase**
   - HMAC-SHA256 signature authentication
   - Timestamp + passphrase verification
   - Secure WebSocket connection with authentication

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without information disclosure
- Rate limiting with backoff strategies
- Secure logging practices (no sensitive data in logs)

### Version Control
- Sensitive files excluded via `.gitignore`
- No hardcoded credentials
- Template files for configuration
- Separate development and production settings

## Deployment Security

### Environment Setup
1. Initialize secure configuration:
```python
from utils.secure_config import secure_config

# First-time setup
secure_config.initialize("your-master-password")

# Load existing configuration
secure_config.load("your-master-password")
```

2. Set API credentials:
```python
from utils.secure_config import ApiCredentials

secure_config.set_api_credentials(
    "binance",
    ApiCredentials(
        api_key="your-api-key",
        api_secret="your-api-secret"
    )
)
```

### File Permissions
Required file permissions:
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.kryptobot
chmod 600 ~/.kryptobot/.key
chmod 600 ~/.kryptobot/config.encrypted
```

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables:
```bash
KRYPTOBOT_ENV=production  # or development
KRYPTOBOT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # or DEBUG for development
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Master Password**
   - Use a strong, unique master password
   - Never share or store the master password
   - Change master password periodically

2. **API Keys**
   - Use read-only API keys when possible
   - Regularly rotate API keys
   - Use IP whitelisting when available
   - Monitor API key usage

3. **System Security**
   - Keep system and dependencies updated
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits

4. **Data Protection**
   - Regular backups of configuration
   - Secure backup storage
   - Data retention policies
   - Proper data disposal

## Incident Response

1. **Security Breach**
   - Immediately revoke compromised API keys
   - Reset master password
   - Review system logs
   - Document incident and response

2. **System Recovery**
   - Restore from secure backup
   - Generate new API keys
   - Update security measures
   - Test system integrity

## Security Updates

The following security measures should be regularly reviewed and updated:
- Encryption methods and key derivation parameters
- API authentication mechanisms
- Rate limiting configurations
- Security dependencies
- Access controls and monitoring
